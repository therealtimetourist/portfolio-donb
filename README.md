Professional Portfolio for Don Bedwell
This is a possible redo of a professional portfolio. This site has been hand-coded by Don Bedwell.

The original code for the site is the Astronomy website template from freewebsitetemplates.com. The original Photoshop .PSD file is in the WORKBENCH directory. The original template was not coded to be responsive.  The recode will now be responsive and incorporate the Bootstrap framework (Bootstrap version 3).  Google Fonts have been incorporated. 

26 December, 2017: The blog template has been updated to use HTML5, Bootstrap and Google Fonts.
